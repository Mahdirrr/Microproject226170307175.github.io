    <p>Hello, I'm Ridham Sachde!
        <br>
        I am originally from Gandhidham, but currently, I am residing in Ahmedabad to pursue a Diploma in Computer Engineering. I have always been fascinated by the world of technology and computers. The ability to develop applications that can make a positive impact on people's lives is what drives my passion for computer engineering.
        
        One of the things I enjoy most about computer engineering is solving logical problems. I find great satisfaction in unraveling complex challenges and coming up with efficient and elegant solutions. As an amateur coder, I have dabbled in various programming languages and have started developing my skills in C, C++, and HTML.
        
        In addition to coding, I have some experience with breadboard and general PCB connections from my personal projects. These hands-on experiences have given me a deeper understanding of hardware components and their integration with software.
        
        Diligence, calmness, and sincerity are some of the qualities that define me. When faced with obstacles, I always strive to find creative ways to overcome them. I enjoy pushing myself to learn new concepts and technologies, continuously expanding my knowledge base in the field of computer engineering.
        
        While I am currently uncertain about the specific job I want to pursue, I am determined to continue my journey in computer engineering. My long-term plan includes pursuing a degree in this field, as I believe it will provide me with a solid foundation to delve deeper into advanced concepts and contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology.
        
        Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, and I look forward to further exploring the fascinating world of computer engineering.
